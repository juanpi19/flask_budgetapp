# flask_budgetapp

This is a website that I created using Flask. Like the Python GUI that I created, this is also a budget app. I refactored the code and push it to a Flask app.
The design is better because I used HTML and CSS to design the website.

The website has four routes:

1. Home: It just tells you about the website, the benefit of using it and how to use it

2. Records: You can add a new expense into the database and all the records are displayed below the form where the records are added.
            next to each record there are two buttons: update and delete, there you can either update or delete a record
            
3. Analaysis: You can see how you have been spending your money. You see the total amount spent and also you can see how much you spend per month

4. Data: this is a table creted using a Pandas Dataframe function, this allows the user to see the whole dataset more organized.
